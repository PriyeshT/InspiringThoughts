Inspiring Thoughts, is an Inspirational App. It presents you with different Inspiring quotes which help you to power yourself through a bad day and help you achieve what you dream. 

V1.0 - The first version of the app was released with basic functionalities. User would be presented new quotes with different background image on click of button. <br/>
v1.1 - Added the functionality to Rate the app and include About section for the app. For Rate functionality, I have used the AppRate_1.1.jar created by TimotheeJeannin. <br/>
v1.1.0 - Added the ReadMe file.<br/>
